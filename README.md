## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. Beyond the surface it seems like you know what sort of opportunities you're in the market for. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.


## Milestone 2 Feedback
Nice work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and well-defined. This will provide you with a good guide for your development phase ahead.

For the portfolio section of your site I would suggest using an interactive gallery such as [Fancy Box](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
You might also want to take a look at this here if you're also looking at making your photos have some animation: https://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/index.html

Additional recommendations:

    Google Fonts for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
    Bootstrap will have all the documentation you need for generating a quick layout for your site.
    FontAwesome is a good quality free library for including iconography.

You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

Your Milestone 2a passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!

## Milestone 3 Feedback
Awesome job on your PWP. I love how clean and simple your site is. The  prallax effect adds a nice pop to your site. The only styling issue I found was the white text color on grey background in the about-me section. I also ran lighthouse audit on your site. Accessibilties, Best Practices, and SEO were all above 90 but your Page Preformance could use a little work. I also ran your site through [W3Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fhiresamuel.com%2F) and only one error. I was happy to see you got both https and your contact form working.
