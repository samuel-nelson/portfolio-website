## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. Beyond the surface it seems like you know what sort of opportunities you're in the market for. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2a.

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.


## Milestone 2 Feedback
Nice work on these wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and well-defined. This will provide you with a good guide for your development phase ahead.

For the portfolio section of your site I would suggest using an interactive gallery such as [Fancy Box](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
You might also want to take a look at this here if you're also looking at making your photos have some animation: https://tympanus.net/Development/HoverEffectIdeas/index.html

Additional recommendations:

    Google Fonts for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
    Bootstrap will have all the documentation you need for generating a quick layout for your site.
    FontAwesome is a good quality free library for including iconography.

You might want to read ahead regarding the contact form integration, and that documentation is here: https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/

Your Milestone 2a passes at Tier IV. You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape!
