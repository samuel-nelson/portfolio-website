		<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p><b>Name: </b>Jeffery H. Donaldson</p>
			<p><b>Age: </b>29</p>
			<p><b>Profession: </b>Lead Hiring Manager at Rural Sourcing in Albuquerque, NM. Rural Sourcing is looking to hire a full-time full-stack web developer to work at their location on Silver and 8th Street. The company focuses on creating and managing web applications for small to medium sized business, providing a reliable service that is affordably priced. Jeffery is the lead manager charged with maintaining the proper amount of developers to continue operations.</p>
			<p><b>Technology: </b>Widows and Linux (Ubuntu) power user. Uses Lenevo Thinkpad X1 Carbon (14”) (Intel Core i5, 16gb RAM, 500gb SSD, dual booting Windows 10, and Ubuntu 18.10). In the office, he primarily uses his company issued HP Omen Desktop computer (Intel Core i7, 16gb RAM, 1TB HHD, 256gb SSD, primarily running windows 10, but is a Hackintosh and can run MacOS X Mojave with a few glitches).  He has 3 Samsung SF350 Series 24” LED Monitors.  His phone is a OnePlus 6T (Snapdragon 845, 8GB RAM, 6.4” AMOLED Display, 16MP and 20MP Cameras, 256GB Storage, running Android OxygenOS).</p>
			<p><b>Attitudes and Behaviors: </b>Jeffery has to deal with an average of a 2.4 year turnover rate at Rural Sourcing, primarily due to the lower wages compared to tech companies in Texas and California. He often finds that entry level employees gain resume boosting experience and then move on to other Tech companies. Although frustrating, the company is acknowledges that this will happen. They only pick the top talent of entry-level web developers. Experience is not required, but having killer skills are. The company must have efficient developers in order to turn a profit. Jeffery is willing to spend significant time finding the right person for the job, because each hire significantly effects the RSI’s bottom line. Jeffery averages a 40 hour week, preferring to work from home most days. He spends his time reaching out to local talent on LinkedIn, reading through local developers code on GitHub, and browsing portfolio websites of developers he finds that have well written code.</p>
			<p><b>Frustrations and Needs:</b> Jeffery needs to hire two full-time full-stack web developers for their Analyst 1 portions that became available this week that need to be filled within the next 3 weeks. Most developers tend to want to move out of State, so most of the top talent ends up leaving the Albuquerque area. Jeffery must find the best that are still around or who are willing to relocate.</p>
		<p><b>Goals: </b>Jeffery's goals are to find a talented full-stack web developer to hire within the next 3 weeks. The develops need to write clean code and be able to fit in well with company culture.</p>
			<p><b>User Story: </b>As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for the entry-level full-stack analyst 1 position.</p>
