		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<p>My website will be a dynamic one page portfolio and consist of the following:</p>
		<p><strong>Welcome: </strong>A brief introduction consisting of my name and job title. This welcome will be overlaid on a background photo.</p>
		<p><strong>About Me: </strong>This section will describe my academic history and languages I know with icons. The tone of voice will be personable and could be described as business casual. The goal of the overall language and feel of the website will help describe myself to potential employers.</p>
		<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>This section will contain 4-6 examples of my best work. Each thumbnail will open up the example in a new tab.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact: </strong>A simple contact form that sends content to my professional email address. In the footer section will be links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow profiles.  </p>
